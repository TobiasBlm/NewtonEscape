# NewtonEscape
This is an Escape Room, built for a school project. the website contains all the needed instructions and quizzes. You'll only have to get the materials for the experiments. The website is partly build on layouts and the other part is build from scratch. The Layout for the index.html site is coming from Nodws on Codepen: https://codepen.io/nodws.
